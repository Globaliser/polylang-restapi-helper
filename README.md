ðŸ§© Polylang RestAPI Helper (MVC WordPress Plugin)

The polylang-restapi-helper plugin is a perfect, focused example of the [ATA MVC WordPress Plugin Framework](https://www.globaliser.com/ata/) in action. Its purpose is simple: to expose some of the Polylang pluginâ€™s functions through the WordPress REST API.

ðŸ”§ How It Applies the ATA Concepts

ðŸ§­ Main Controller

Files:
	â€¢	polylang-restapi-helper.php
	â€¢	app/controllers/polylangrestapihelper-controller.php

The plugin follows the Main Controller pattern.
The root PHP file instantiates PolylangRestapiHelperController, which serves as the entry point for the entire plugin.

â¸»

ðŸ“¡ API Class

File:
	â€¢	app/apis/polylangrestapihelper-api.php

This is the heart of the plugin.
The PolylangRestapiHelperApi class contains logic for:
	â€¢	Handling incoming requests
	â€¢	Calling Polylangâ€™s core functions
	â€¢	Sending back formatted JSON responses

â¸»

ðŸš¦ Routes

File:
	â€¢	app/routes/main-routes.php

This file acts as the routing switchboard, mapping REST endpoints like:

/get-post-lang-relations/123

to the appropriate method inside the PolylangRestapiHelperApi class.

â¸»

ðŸš« No Views or Services

This plugin does not have:
	â€¢	app/views/
	â€¢	app/services/

Why?
	â€¢	It has no UI
	â€¢	Its logic is simple enough to be kept inside the API class
	â€¢	In more complex plugins, the logic inside API methods would be delegated to a Service class
